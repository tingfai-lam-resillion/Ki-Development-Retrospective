### **Theme 2: Gaps in Collaboration and Communication**

Effective teamwork requires open communication and shared knowledge. On this project, gaps in these areas made it difficult for the team to collaborate effectively, leading to process breakdowns and a lack of shared ownership.

**Observation: Project Knowledge Was Siloed**

Critical project information was concentrated, rather than shared.
*   **Requirements Were Not Widely Available:** Key information, such as the specific pass/fail criteria for tests and the evolving log file formats, was not documented or consistently shared with the whole team. This made it challenging for team members to contribute to the core analysis logic or provide meaningful technical feedback.
*   **This Created a Dependency:** As a result, the project became heavily dependent on a single team member's interpretation of Philips' requirements, limiting the team's ability to collaborate on solutions or anticipate challenges.

**Observation: The Ticketing System Was Not an Effective Tool**

The Azure board was intended to be the central hub for tracking work, but it did not accurately reflect the project's status.
*   **Work Was Not Tracked in Real-Time:** Development often happened outside of the ticketed process. The board was frequently updated after the fact, with tickets moved in batches, which meant it could not be relied upon for a clear view of progress.
*   **Planning Was Disconnected from Execution:** Detailed plans and effort estimates were created in tickets, but these were not used to guide the actual development work. This disconnect meant that the ticketing system became more of an administrative record than a proactive project management tool.

**Observation: Communication Was Not Always Collaborative**

While the team had daily standups, these meetings did not always foster deep collaboration.
*   **Standups Focused on Status, Not Problem-Solving:** The daily meetings were often limited to individual status updates rather than serving as a forum for collaborative technical discussions or problem-solving.
*   **Key Decisions Occurred Outside the Team:** Important decisions about features or technical direction were sometimes made in direct conversations with Philips or through individual work, without being brought back to the full team for alignment.

These gaps in communication and knowledge sharing resulted in a fragmented team effort, where individuals often worked in parallel rather than as a cohesive unit.

**Observation: Attempts to Course-Correct Were Unsuccessful**

It is important to note that these process and architectural issues were raised by the senior developer on multiple occasions during the project. Efforts were made to establish a more structured architectural foundation and to address the growing technical debt.

However, without a clear mandate from project management to prioritize these concerns, and with a development process that allowed for unilateral decisions and overwriting of changes, these attempts to course-correct were consistently unsuccessful. This highlights a key gap: a process that allows for raising issues is not effective without a parallel process for ensuring those issues are formally addressed and resolved.
