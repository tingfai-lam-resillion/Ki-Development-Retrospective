### **Executive Summary**

The Ki Test Results Analyzer was delivered to Philips and is functional, meeting the customer's immediate needs. This retrospective analyzes the development process to identify lessons that can help us build more sustainable and maintainable software in the future.

While the project achieved its primary goal, the execution resulted in a product with significant technical debt and operational risks. This document is a process-focused assessment intended to highlight opportunities for improvement.

**Key Observations and Business Impact:**

1.  **High Cost of Future Changes:** The application was built with a monolithic architecture that makes it difficult to modify. This has immediate business implications, as demonstrated by Philips' recent request to integrate our analysis tool with their test runner systems. What should be a straightforward enhancement has become a complex and costly undertaking due to the current codebase. This directly impacts our ability to respond to customer needs efficiently.

2.  **Inconsistent Development Process:** The project did not adhere to a consistent development methodology or version control strategy. This resulted in duplicated efforts, abandoned architectural work, and a lack of visibility into the true status of the project. This makes it difficult for teams to collaborate effectively and for management to make informed decisions.

3.  **Concentrated Project Knowledge:** Critical information, from customer requirements to technical implementation details, was not consistently documented or shared across the team. This creates a "key person dependency," which is a significant operational risk for the business.

These are concrete challenges that impact our agility, increase long-term costs, and introduce risk. This document breaks down how these situations arose and provides clear, constructive recommendations to strengthen our development processes for future projects.
